1a) Flexible model should be used. We have extremely large training set, more flexible model will have less MSE up to some level.
One should be careful about overfitting.

1b) Less flexible model should be used. We have few observations, very unflexible model such as straight line and flexible model won't
have a very significant impact. Because of extremely large predictors flexible model has a high chance to overfit.

1c) Flexible model. If their correlation is non-linear, more flexible model would fit better to training set.

1d) Less flexible model. If we have high irreducable error we may force the model to fit the data and end up with overfit.

2a) n=500, p=3 Regression because we are working with CEO salary, numerical. Inference because we relate the outcome with p's.

2b) n=20, p=13 Classification because outcome is not numerical, 0 or 1 in this case. Prediction our aim is to predict if it is 0 or 1.

2c) same logic applies.
