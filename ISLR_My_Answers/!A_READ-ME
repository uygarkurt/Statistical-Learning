I will share my answers to the exercises of the book ISLR(An Introduction to Statistical Learning). I'm using 7th edition of the book.
Everyone can use my answers. Important point is make sure you understand. If I made an error don't hesitate to contact.

I follow Stanford's online course Statistical Learning.

!!!THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED SINCE IT GREATLY OVERLAPS WITH MACHINE LEARNING. I MAY LOOK AT JUST CERTAIN CHAPTERS!!!
